         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Officer comming <hi>Iune</hi> 11th. laſt paſt to my Houſe, about 6. of the Clock in the morning, cal'd me out of my Bed, and after I had read his warrant, I told him that if there were not a tye of reſpect laid upon me to the Lords, for their faire and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing with me about my buſines, that was lately depending before them, I would not in the preſent caſe, obey their warrant, nor twenty more of the like nature, but would defend myſelfe in my own houſe (which is my Caſtle) againſt all that in ſuch caſes they ſhould ſend unto me, to the death, becauſe they have by the Law, no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at all to mak me dance attendance upon them, in the preſent caſe, or to try me a <hi>Commoner,</hi> in any Criminall cauſe whatſoever, ceither for Life, Limb, liberty or eſtate, which I told him was the caſe now in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for his own warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon me to appeare to anſwer a charge then before their Lordſhips, and this I wiſhed him to tell them muſt be my plea at their Barre at which, having promiſed him to appeare, he departed, ſo fitting my ſelfe in the beſt manner the preſent <hi>In-comes</hi> of God inabled me for the brunt.</p>
            <p>J tooke my Journey towards <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and in the ſtreets meditating, deſired God according to his wonted manner to direct me, <hi>I</hi> preſently had contrived in my own brain, without any humane help in the world, a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> and appeal, my heart
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113664:3"/>
being ſet up ſo high to go on with it, although it ſhould be preſent death unto me, ſo I took ſanctuary at a friends lodging to compile it in a method, which being done I tranſcribed it faire with my owne hand, and then ſet my hand and ſeale unto it, and being loth to run ſo high a conteſt with the Houſe of Peers if by any meanes poſſible I could avoid it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> repaired to a Lord a member of that Houſe, and told him my whole heart in my intentions, ſhewed him my paper, and read part of it to him, and deſired him to till ſome more of the Lords of it, if he judged it convenient, that ſo they might a little better conſider of it before they brought me to their Barre, and forced me to doe that that would tend to their extaordrnary dishonour, or my ruine and diſtruction, and doe it I both muſt and would by Gods aſſiſtance (I told him) if they called me to their Barre, telling him I judged it as baſe an action in me (both in the ſight of God and man) to betray my knowne and fundamentall liberties, as with my owne hands to cut my owne throat, proteſting unto him, that if he and the reſt of the Lords indevoured to deſtroy <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and to tread, it under their feet, as they would doe if they medled with me in this caſe, I would draw my ſword againſt them every man as freely as I would doe againſt the King, and the deſperateſt Cavalier with him, with much more that then I told him he departed to the Houſe, and I imediatly by water followed him, and what he did in it <hi>I</hi> doe not fully know, but I was not called in till about one a clock:</p>
            <p>And being commanded to their Barr, <hi>the Earl of Mancheſter (their Speaker) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Maſter</hi> Smith <hi>to ſhew me my printed Epiſtle to Iudge</hi> Reeves, <hi>and asked me (to this effect) if I knew that booke, and whether I did not leave (or cauſe to be left) one of them at Iudge</hi> Reeves <hi>houſe for the Iudge himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto which <hi>I</hi> replyed, my Lord, if it may ſtand with the pleaſure of this Houſe, I deſire to know whether or no you have any formall or legall charge againſt me in writing, if they had <hi>I</hi> deſired to ſee it? that ſo <hi>I</hi> might read it, and then <hi>I</hi> would give them an anſwer to their queſtion</p>
            <p>Whereupon after a little pawze and looking one upon another, the Earle of Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſtept up and with much zeale preſſed his Lordſhip to hould me to the queſtion, (ſo ſaith the Earle of Mancheſter) <hi>anſwer to the queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord (ſaid <hi>I</hi>) under favour, <hi>I</hi> conceive the thing <hi>I</hi> deſire of your Lordſhip, is very juſt and rationall (&amp; ſo it is if you conſider their owne ſummons which expreſly commands me to appeare before them to anſwere a charge) but if nothing will ſerve your turne but a poſſitive anſwere to the queſtion, then my Lord there is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in writing under my hand and ſeale, which <hi>I</hi> will juſtifie and maintaine to the death, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you it may be read;</p>
            <p>And with this <hi>I</hi> gave my paper to Maſter <hi>Smith</hi> their Cleark then at their Barre: Whereupon the Earle of Lincolne ſtept up and ſaid to the Speaker, <hi>my Lord what have wee to doe with his paper? command him to anſwer to the queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi> (ſaith the Earle of Mancheſter) <hi>the Lords command you to anſwer poſitively to the queſtion,</hi> unto which <hi>I</hi> replyed my Lord, in that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Maſter <hi>Smiths</hi> hand is my anſwer to the queſtion, and to all others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that you ſhall ask me, and no other anſwer <hi>I</hi> have to give you, neither ſhall <hi>I,</hi> and if that will ſatisfy you well and good, if not, ſeeke it where you can have it, for <hi>I</hi> for my part ſhall give you no other, where upon <hi>I</hi> was commanded to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113664:3"/>And one of the Lords commanded the Cleark to give me my paper, <hi>(for ſaith he, what ſhall wee doe with it)</hi> but <hi>I</hi> refuſed to take it, and tould them, <hi>I</hi> would not medle nor make with it, there it was, and it was enough to me, that <hi>I</hi> had delivered it at their open Barre, do what you will with it, for my Lords, <hi>I</hi> am as careleſſe as you are, whether you will read it or no, ſo the Cleark threw it after me, but I would not medle with it, but withdrew, the words of which thus followeth.</p>

            <p>The knowledge and underſtanding of which, hath made your petitioner as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner (in his Countries ſtraits and neceſſities) to take up armes as his duty, to fight againſt the King (the ſervant of the Common wealth) and all the forces rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Authority (who ſought to deſtroy the end of Government, the ſafety and weale of the people) and to be faithfull in your ſaid ſervice, in the midſt of many deaths; contemning and ſlighting, the large proffers of the Kings Honours and preferments, ſent unto him by foure Lords, when he was a priſoner for you at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for which he was imediatly laid in Irons night and day, lockt up cloſe in a room, a Centinell ſet at his dore, that ſo he might not ſpeak with any whoſoever, forced to lye on the floore, kept without one farthing of allowance although he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not one penny with him to the priſon</p>
            <p>And within a few daies after was (for his continued reſolution) arraigned (in Irons) as a Traitor for his life before Judge <hi>Heath,</hi> before whom he pleaded to his indictment, profeſſing unto him at the open barre (when he preſſed your petitioner to ſave himſelfe) that he your ſupplyant was not ſeduced by any to take up armes, but did it out of a principle of duty to himſelfe, his country and the Paliament, and that he was reſolved to ſpend his blood in the defence of his owne and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries liberties; alſo your petitioner upon the ſame grounds, hath often been in the field ſince, and done good ſervices, and hath continued faithfull in all his ingagements, and is reſolved (by the ſtrength of God) ſo to doe to the death.</p>
